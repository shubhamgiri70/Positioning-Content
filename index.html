               <p class="art-text">Throughout the years, coffee shops and cafés alike have become so much more than just a place to acquire a delicious brew. 
                Since the first coffee shops were established, they have been used as social places to congregate and meeting points for the public.
                 Alongside the development of coffee shops came the ‘coffee culture’, a set of traditions and rules regarding the way cafes are used, 
                 and the way these delicious brews are enjoyed.Coffee shops are everywhere, not just on our city’s high streets, but globally beloved. 
                 They offer an atmosphere that is warm and inviting, with a focus on the ambiance and aesthetic of the space as well as the services they offer, 
                 with some cafes housing multiple functions beyond the brew. Therefore, the question stands: how are coffee shops today tapping into creating new spaces
                  that are interesting and bring new life to the beloved culture? Located in Chaoyang, China, Blufish Yingke is a coffee shop in the daytime and a bar in the evening.
